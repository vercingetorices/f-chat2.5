# fchat2.5

drag-and-drop theme improvements for f-chat 3.0 and f-chat rising

probably make sure your client is all the way updated first.

then, drop the .css files you want (the ones labeled "improved", the unlabeled ones are stock) into the `fchat\<your version>\resources\app\themes` directory, (located at `C:\Users\<your name>\AppData\Local` on Windows) restart your client, and toggle between them

then, you should probably bump the font size down (in settings) around 2 points or so.
