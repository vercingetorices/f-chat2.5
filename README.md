# fchat2.5

drag-and-drop theme improvements for f-chat 3.0 and f-chat rising

probably make sure your client is all the way updated first.

then, drop the .css files you want into the `fchat\<your version>\resources\app\themes` directory, (located at `C:\Users\<your name>\AppData\Local` on Windows) restart your client, and toggle between them

then, you should probably bump the font size down (in settings) around 2 points or so.

if you would like to trust me (and you really shouldn't), you can also replace the chat.js file (FOR YOUR SPECIFIC NUMERICAL VERSION OF F-CHAT 3.0/RISING with the one listed for additional tweaks. ***don't do this unless you know what you are doing, you will have to reinstall your client if you screw it up.***
